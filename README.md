Hi there, I'm Mohsen [Mo-h-sen]! 👋

🌟 About Me

I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology. I currently have the opportunity to be a visiting Ph.D. student at the Computer Lab at the University of Cambridge.
My research focuses on developing explainable and trustworthy AI-based algorithms for decision-making in healthcare and industrial environments. I am currently focused on developing explainable decision-support tools for medical imaging.

I am also passionate about photography, travel, art, history, hiking, running, bouldering, and soccer. If you're into photography, feel free to check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eyewitness_23).
